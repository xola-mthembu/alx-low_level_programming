Project Description:  Its purpose was to explore and grasp concepts related to arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, variable declaration, and loops in the C language.
0-positive_or_negative.c
This code generates a random number and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero. It uses conditional statements to check the value of the number and prints the corresponding message.

1-last_digit.c
The code generates a random number and prints its last digit. It also checks if the last digit is greater than 5, less than 6 and not 0, or equal to 0, and prints the corresponding message.

2-print_alphabet.c
This code prints the lowercase alphabet in a sequential manner using a for loop.

3-print_alphabets.c
The code prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets in a sequential manner using a for loop.

4-print_alphabt.c
This code prints the lowercase alphabet excluding the letters 'q' and 'e' using a for loop and conditional statements.

5-print_numbers.c
The code prints the numbers from 0 to 9 using a for loop.

6-print_numberz.c
This code prints the numbers from 0 to 9 using a for loop and the putchar function.

7-print_tebahpla.c
The code prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, starting from 'z' and ending at 'a', using a for loop and the putchar function.

8-print_base16.c
This code prints the numbers from 0 to 9 and the lowercase letters from 'a' to 'f' using two for loops and the putchar function.

9-print_comb.c
The code prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by commas and spaces. It uses a for loop and conditional statements to print the numbers and separators.

100-print_comb3.c
This code prints all possible combinations of two different digits in ascending order. It uses nested for loops and conditional statements to generate and print the combinations.

101-print_comb4.c
The code prints all possible combinations of three different digits in ascending order. It uses nested for loops and conditional statements to generate and print the combinations.

102-print_comb5.c
This code prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers in ascending order. It uses nested for loops and conditional statements to generate and print the combinations.
