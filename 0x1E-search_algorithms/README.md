# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It includes implementations of various search algorithms in C. The algorithms implemented include:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Jump Search
- Exponential Search
- Interpolation Search
- Advanced Binary Search

Each algorithm is tested for functionality and performance, ensuring compliance with specific coding standards set by the program.

## Files

Each task has a corresponding C file that contains the implementation of the search algorithm, as well as a main test file for demonstrating functionality.

## Usage

To compile the programs, use the following gcc command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 <main-file.c> <search-function-file.c> -o <output-name>
